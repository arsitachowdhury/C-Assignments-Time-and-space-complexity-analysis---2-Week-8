3.Calculate the time complexity for the following code snippet.
int c = 0;
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
for(int j = 1; j * j < n; j *= 2) {
c++;
}
}

Answer

Explanation:
The outer for loop runs from i = 0 to i < n, so it iterates n times.The inner loop runs while jâˆ—j<n, with j starting from 1 and doubling in each iteration (j *= 2).

Time Complexity:
The overall time complexity is O(nlogn).
