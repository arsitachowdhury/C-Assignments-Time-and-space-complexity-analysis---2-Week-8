1. Calculate the time complexity for the following code snippet.
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
for(int j = 0; j * j < n; j++) {
cout << “PhysicsWallah ”;
}
}

Answer

Explanation:
The outer for loop runs from i = 0 to i < n, meaning it runs n times.The inner loop has a condition j * j < n, meaning it runs while the square of j is less than n. To find how many times this loop runs, we need to calculate the largest j such that square of j<n.

The overall time complexity is O(nrootn).
